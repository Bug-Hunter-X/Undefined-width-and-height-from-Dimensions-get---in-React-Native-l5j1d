This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` methods return an object with `width` and `height` properties.  However, if you access these properties before the component has mounted or before the layout has been calculated, the values will be undefined or null, leading to errors.
