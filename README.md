This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Dimensions API in React Native. The issue arises when accessing screen dimensions before the component has fully mounted and the layout is calculated. This can lead to undefined width and height values, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior. The provided solution shows how to correctly handle this issue using either component's lifecycle methods or the useEffect hook.
